  Create the rules for an object describing a plasmacutter. The object is an NGSI-LD object, i.e. it has a type and an id. And it has one relationship 
  to to a workpiece of type iff:workpiece, called iff:hasWorkpiece. iff stands for an rdfs prefix. The plasmacutter object can have at most one iff:hasWorkpiece 
  relationship.
  Create the shacl.tll file for this object and three ngsi-ld example models. model1.jsonld is compliant and linkes to an existing object of type iff:workpiece,
  model2.jsonld has a non existing relationship and model3.jsonld has wrong cardinality of iff:hasWorkpiece relationship.
  Create also the referenced workpiece shape wich describes a filter with unrelated properties.
