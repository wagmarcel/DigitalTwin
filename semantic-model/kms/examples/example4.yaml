  Create the rules for an object describing an inudstrial exhaustion filter. The object is an NGSI-LD object, i.e. it has a type and an id. And it has one property, 
  called iff:strength describing the strength of the filter operation. iff stands for an rdfs prefix. The filter object must have exactly one iff:strength property. The
  value of the strength value is a percentage of the maximal streangth.
  Create the shacl.tll file for this object and three ngsi-ld example objects. model1.jsonld is compliant, in model2.jsonld strength has a too high value and 
  model3.jsonld has too low value.
