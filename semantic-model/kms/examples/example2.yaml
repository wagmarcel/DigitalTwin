  Create the rules for an object describing a plasmacutter. The object is an NGSI-LD object, i.e. it has a type and an id. And it has one relationship 
  to to another object of type iff:filter, called iff:hasFilter. iff stands for an rdfs prefix. The plasmacutter object must have exactly one iff:hasFilter 
  relationship. 
  Create the shacl.tll file for this object and three ngsi-ld example models. model1.jsonld is compliant and linkes to an existing object of type iff:filter,
  model2.jsonld has a non existing relationship and model3.jsonld has wrong cardinality of iff:hasFilter field.
  Create also the referenced filter shape wich describes a filter with unrelated properties.
