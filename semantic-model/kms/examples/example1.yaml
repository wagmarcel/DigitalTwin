  Create the rules for an object describing a plasmacutter. The object is an NGSI-LD object, i.e. it has a type and an id. And it has one property, 
  called iff:state. iff stands for an rdfs prefix. The plasmacutter object must have exactly one iff:state property. the value must be a string literal.
  Create the shacl.tll file for this object and three ngsi-ld example objects. object1.jsonld is compliant, object2.jsonld has a wrong Literal and 
  object3.jsonld has wrong cardinality of iff:state field.
